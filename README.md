# The Parallax Art Gallery

This Project aims to extend the experience of art by introducing a new 2.5D experience using the gyroscope or mouse location of the device and several depth layers.

# Art Submission

Art submission can be done by sending me an email at [mohannadize15@gmail.com](mailto:mohannadize15@gmail.com). I know this is a very inefficient way of doing this but for the moment, this is the only way :).

Example for the depth layers can be found in the examples folder.

## Disclaimer

**This Project does not aim to vandalize the art by any mean, it is just a fun experiment and experience for us and anyone who uses it.**

I start this project using `react-js` as a fun project to learn react but I'm willing to change this to a lighter `vanilla-js` version soon for better performance.
