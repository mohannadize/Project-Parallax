# The Parallax Art Gallery

This Project aims to extend the experience of art by introducing a new 2.5D experience using the gyroscope or mouse location of the device and several depth layers.

## Art Submission

Art submission can be done by sending me an email at [mohannadize15@gmail.com](mailto:mohannadize15@gmail.com). I know this is a very inefficient way of doing this but for the moment, this is the only way :).

Example for the depth layers can be found in the examples folder.

the new build will be genrated in a `build` directory.

### Disclaimer
